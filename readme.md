## Running tests

To initialize the testing, you have two choices:

1. If you have `bundler` installed, just run the `bundle` command in your shell.
2. Or install [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) by hand: `gem install jasmine`. If you want to run your tests without a browser also install the headless webkit using: `gem install jasmine-headless-webkit`.

Done this you also have two choices. You can either run the **test in the browser**:

    rake jasmine
    open http://localhost:8888

or **directly in the shell** (if you have done step 1. or the full step 2.):

    jasmine-webkit-headless -c
